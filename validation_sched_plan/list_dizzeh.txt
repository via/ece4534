Notes and stuffs: Here's a list of tasks I could remember and write up for 
the validation and schedule plan. Stuff in <text> need fixing or more details.

Webserver [<member name>]
    - Implementation: Modify index.shtml and serve it the way the demo does
        OR utilize file system (to-be-implemented) to serve the web page.
        - Task: Modify index.shtml as first method to serve page from 
                FreeRTOS webserver demo implementation <insert target date>
        - Task: Once filesystem implemented, determine if webserver skeleton
                can serve pages through uIP <insert target date>
    - Validation: Going to <IP Address> provides a web page which displays GPS
        and position data
      
LCD for displaying data [<member name>]
    - Implementation: Create format for displaying the GPS and position data
        to the user.
        - Task: Determine placement of data and how data is displayed <insert target date>
        - Task: Once filesystem is complete, insure that data can be grabbed
            from file for display <insert target date>
        - Task: Finalize display layout and actual data display <insert target date>
    - Validation: All GPS and calculated position data for a session should show
        on the LCD and <data should refresh at set intervals>
      
<Position calculation task on ARM?>
      
Filesystem [<member name>]
    - Implementation: FAT16 filesystem will be implemented on ARM board for
        log files and <possibly serve web page>
        - Task: <Implement FAT16 on ARM> <insert target date>
    - Validation: GPS data or calculated position data will be written to file
        to be stored on sdcard using the implemented filesystem.
        
Mobile Unit GPS Management [<member name>]
    - Implementation: <Make set of messages/commands that the ARM will be able 
        to send to the GPS unit through PIC0>
        - Task: Make mobile unit with MiWi and GPS receiver <insert target date>
        - Task: Make <communication method/messages/command> between mobile unit 
            and ARM board <insert target date>
        - Task: Make ARM capable of sending commands to GPSr through PIC0 
            <insert target date>
    - Validation: Use the ARM to send the GPS command of <command>, the GPS 
        should <action> and the <data shows change due to action?>
        
<Wireless communication with MiWi boards?>
        
Daughterboard Design [<member name>]
    - Implementation: <Create schematic for board's design and then create teh
        board.>
    - Validation: <The board exists.> [2012/02/28]
        
I2C [<member name>]
    - Implementation: PIC <--> ARM [2012/02/21]
    - Validation: [00:16] Justin: hm
                  [00:16] Justin: validation for i2c
                  [00:16] Justin: logic analyzer
                  
<Other tasks that I forgot because I'm tired>

<Other tasks that need to be determined>
