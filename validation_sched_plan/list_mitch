Task: Long distance I2C communications
Deadline: March 6
Validation: Successful reliable communications along 75'+ of cabling
Depends on: I2C communication
Who: Mitch

Task: Position calculation algorithm
Deadline: March 9
Validation: Given reasonable RSSI input, the position calculator provides some reasonable position output
Who: Mitch

Integration Task: Position Calculator + ARM
Deadline: March 18
Validation: Position calculator output is fed to ARM display and other interfaces
Depends on: MiWi to MiWi comm
Who: Mitch, Justin

Task: UART communication with GPSr
Deadline: March 1
Validation: Using a bus sniffer, verify that NMEA data is travelling over the UART.  Then using a bus master device, request position data over I2C
Depends on: 45J10 adaptation
Who: Via

Task: Adapt existing 18F2580 code to 18F45J10
Deadline: Feb 28
Validation: Using a bus sniffer, verify I2C read/write operations are successful to all 45J10 devices
Who: Mitch, Via

Task: PIC to MiWi communication SPI
Deadline: March 1
Validation: Successful read & write to MiWi registers (e.g. set Tx power, then read to verify setting)
Depends on: 45J10 adaptation
Who: Via

Task: MiWi to MiWi communications
Deadline: March 16
Validation: Sending predetermined bytestrings over MiWi with confirmed reception
Depends on: PIC to MiWi comm
Who: Mitch, Via

Task: Node PCB Design
Deadline: March 9
Validation: It exists
Depends on: long distance I2C
Who: Mitch, Andrew

Integration Task: GPS data to ARM board
Deadline: March 20
Validation: GPS position is displayed on ARM
Depends on: MiWi to MiWi, PIC to GPSr
Who: Via, Justin

Integration Task: Board Assembly
Deadline: March 20
Validation: It works
Depends on: PCB Design
Who: Everyone (4 boards, 4 people)

Task: Web Server
Deadline: March 1
Validation: Custom content is displayed on the webpage
Depends on: nothing
Who: Andrew

Integration Task: Test Position Data to Web Server
Deadline: March 9
Validation: Changing position data is able to be displayed on the webpage (even if the 'changing' data is just hardcoded at this time)
Depends on: nothing (could depend on GPS->ARM, but this needs to be tested and verified beforehand)
Who: Andrew, Justin

Integration Task: Actual Position Data to Web Server
Deadline: April 5
Validation: GPSr position data, and calculated position is displayed on the webpage
Depends on: GPS data to ARM, Test position data to web server, position calculator + ARM, calibration sequence, board assembly
Who: Everyone (one of the most important things in the project)

Task: Filesystem
Deadline: March 13
Validation: Successful text file creation on a computer-readable filesystem
Depends on: nothing
Who: Via

Integration Task: Position Data to Filesystem
Deadline: April 5
Validation: GPSr position data, and calculated position is written to a flat text file
Depends on: Filesystem, GPS data to ARM, position calculator + ARM, calibration sequence, board assembly
Who: Everyone

Task: Calibration sequence
Deadline: March 27
Validation: ARM Display or Web page displays GPS position of all three receiever nodes
Depends on: GPS data to ARM, board assembly
Who: Andrew
