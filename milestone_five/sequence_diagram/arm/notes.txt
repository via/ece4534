GPIO pins used to check tasks
Pins go high when task begins work after MQ receive
Pins go low when done with task and it gets back to the blocking call of waiting for MQ

Screenshot key:
- :0 is the filetask happens after calculation task
- :1 is LCD task happens after calculation
- :2 is I2C task first task to happen in any cycle, calculation task should follow
- :3 is Calculation task, happens after I2C and before File

2 - 3 - 0/1

It's kind of hard to see the tasks, I probably should've taken better screenshots.
